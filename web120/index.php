 <p> A little bit about myself, I am originally from a small town called Piketon in southern Ohio. I joined the NAVY and moved away shortly after high school. It was thanks to the NAVY that I was first introduced to the PNW. I immediately fell in love with everything that it has to offer whether itâ€™s hiking, camping, or just going to the coast for a few days it has it all. Needless to say Washington is now my home.
